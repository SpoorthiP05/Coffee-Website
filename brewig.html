<h2>Brewing</h2>

<p>Brewed coffee is made by pouring hot water onto ground coffee beans, then allowing to brew. There are several methods for doing this, including using a filter, a percolator, and a French press. Terms used for the resulting coffee often reflect the method used, such as drip brewed coffee, filtered coffee, pour-over coffee, immersion brewed coffee, or simply coffee. Water seeps through the ground coffee, absorbing its constituent chemical compounds, and then passes through a filter. The used coffee grounds are retained in the filter, while the brewed coffee is collected in a vessel such as a carafe or pot.</p>

<p>It may be observed, especially when using a tall, narrow carafe, that the coffee at the bottom of the coffeepot is stronger than that at the top. This is because less flavor is available for extraction from the coffee grounds as the brewing process progresses. A mathematical argument has been made that delivering comparable strength in two cups of coffee is nearly achieved using a Thue-Morse sequence of pours.[6] This analysis prompted a whimsical article in the popular press.</p>

<h3 id="Pour Over/Drip: Coffee Cone">Pour Over/Drip: Coffee Cone.</h3>

<p>One of the oldest, simplest, fastest and cheapest ways to brew coffee is the drip method using a coffee cone and paper filter. Hot water is poured evenly over coffee grounds in a paper filter. With gravity, the brewed coffee drips slowly and directly into a cup or pot. Coffee cones are made of plastic, glass, stainless steel or ceramic. The shape of the cone and their filters will influence the flavours. Popular brands include Melitta, Hario V60, Kalita Wave and Bee House.</p>

<p>Chemex is a beautifully designed and elegant pour over, glass flask that was invented in 1941 by Dr. Peter Schlumbohm. It uses a special Chemex paper filter that is 20-30% heavier than other filters. Similar to the coffee cone, hot water is poured over coffee grounds in a paper filter. The brewed coffee drips into the bottom of the flask which doubles as its own carafe.</p>

<h3 id="Plunger/Press: French Press">Plunger/Press: French Press.</h3>

<p>The French Press method, invented in 1929, is widely considered as the best and easiest method for brewing superior and consistent coffee. It extracts, arguably, more superior flavours than any other method. In a press pot, ground coffee is soaked, steeped and strained in hot water; therefore, coffeeâ€™s flavourful essential oils, caffeine and antioxidants are better diffused and preserved leaving the purest flavours of the coffee. It is well suited for coffee drinkers that enjoy a luscious, expressive and complex taste experience.  Refer to our 5 Tips and Steps For Brewing Better Coffee at Home for more details about this method. The most common brand is Bodum.</p>

<h3 id="Plunger/Press: AeroPress">Plunger/Press: AeroPress.</h3>

<p>Relatively new, the maker of Aerobie Frisbee (Alan Adler) created and launched the AeroPress in 2005. The AeroPress is plastic and comes in 3 parts. A filter sits in a coffee basket at the bottom of the brew chamber. Coffee grounds rest in the brew chamber where hot water is added then immerses/steeps the coffee. To extract the coffee, a plunger is pressed down creating air pressure to force brewed coffee through a filter and into a cup.</p>

<h3 id="Percolate: Stovetop Moka Pot">Percolate: Stovetop Moka Pot.</h3>

<p>Originally patented in 1933 by Alfonso Bialetti, stovetop style coffee makers use steam pressure from boiled water in the lower section to pass through coffee grounds in the mid chamber of the pot. Brewed coffee then sits in the higher chamber. A well designed stovetop pot will created better pressure. Common brands include Bialetti, Pedrini, and Kabalo.</p>

<h3 id="Vacuum: Siphon">Vacuum: Siphon.</h3>

<p>The siphon is a fancy and flashy coffee maker. It can be a fun way to make coffee and impress friends at the same time, but it can be a fussy process. It was invented in Germany in the 1840s. Coffee grounds are added to the upper vessel and vapor pressure forces hot water up to immerse the coffee. Once the heat is removed, gravity pushes the brewed coffee back through a filter into the bottom vessel. Common brands include Hario, Yama and Bodum.</p>
